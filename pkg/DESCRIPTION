Description: R2STATS is a gWidgetsRGtk2 GUI for fitting and comparing GLM and GLMM (based on Douglas Bates' lme4 package) in R. It is designed to make comparisons between numerous models easy, both numerically and graphically. Relevant plots are automatically produced for each model family. R2STATS is *not* a graphical interface for R, but for statistical modelling in a model comparison approach.
